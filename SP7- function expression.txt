As you know, a function expression is a function that is declared inside an expression. 
You're already familiar with the most common cases where we can use function expressions:

// a function stored in a variable
const double = function (num) {
  return num * 2;
};

// a function passed through a method
[1, 2, 3].map(function (item) {
  return item * 2;
});
