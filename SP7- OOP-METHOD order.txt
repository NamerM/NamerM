PARENT
_getTemplate() will go in the parent class. The method gets a markup template using a 
specific selector. Each card is going to need to do this.

_setEventListeners() and _handleMessageClick() will go in the parent class. 
These methods assign functionality to our cards depending on certain events. 
All of our cards will need to work with events.


CHILD
generateCard() will go in the child class. 
This method will populate cards with their data and functionality. 
Currently, we have two types of cards with different data, meaning each will need 
its own method.
