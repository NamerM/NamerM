***Pass by Reference ***
Two events occur when you create an object: 1)The object itself is created and stored in memory.
2)A link to this location in memory is added to a variable.(reference)

const firstObj = {
    one: 1,
    two: 2
};

let secondObj = firstObj;
secondObj = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 };

console.log(firstObj); //" one: 1, two: 2 "
